# ProjectEuler-Solutions-Haskell
This repository focuses to solve problems at the website Project Euler using a Functional oriented programming language called Haskell.

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about) is a wonderful website for practicing mathematical solutions using programming which gave me an idea to practice the problems using the Haskell language. Project Euler is a fantastic website, do check it out!

## Run the functions
1. Make sure you have haskell GHCi installed in your computer.
1. Clone to repository to your local directory
1. Change your current directory to the local cloned git repository
1. Start GHCi from the terminal.
1. enter `:l filename.hs` to load the file.
1. call the functions that are present in the loaded file with desired inputs to get the output.
